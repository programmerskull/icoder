                <h2 id="careers-in-coding">Careers in Coding </h2>
                <p>Coding (or computer programming) is an invaluable skill to have in this day and age. As you probably know by now, the answer to "<a href="https://www.thinkful.com/blog/what-does-a-coder-do/" rel="noreferrer noopener">what does a coder do</a>"
                    varies widely by industry. If you learn how to code, you’ll open the door to a wide choice of careers.</p>
                <p>Some of the most popular coding-related positions available are: </p>
                <p><strong>Computer Programmer </strong></p>
                <p>Programmers create software that performs useful tasks. They have to ensure their code is bug-free and meets client expectations. Programmers usually work in large teams and are required to not only write code but read and update existing
                    code. </p>
                <p>Computer programmers are masters of Java, C#, C++, and Python.</p>
                <p><strong>Web Developer</strong></p>
                <p>Both <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/blog/front-end-developer-vs-back-end-developer/">front-end and back-end web development</a> roles require coding skills.</p>
                <p>Front-end developers are responsible for anything the user can see or interact with. This includes images, layouts, buttons, menus, content, and the entire look and feel of the site.</p>
                <p>Back-end developers write code to implement site functionality. They’re responsible for managing databases, writing server-side code, the architecture of the system, and the server configuration.</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.thinkful.com/blog/how-to-become-a-web-developer-4-possible-paths/">As a web developer</a>, you’re expected to know basic languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Knowledge of languages such as Python, C#, Java, and
                    SQL are also useful.</p>
                <p><strong>Mobile App Developer</strong></p>
                <p>A mobile app developer is responsible for creating apps that run on smartphones and tablets.</p>
                <p>This branch of development faces unique challenges. <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/blog/how-to-become-an-app-developer/">App developers</a> need to provide the same user experience across multiple devices. Apps must work well on small
                    screens without relying on a keyboard for user input.</p>
                <p>A growing number of users prefer using mobile devices to desktop PCs. This has caused the demand for mobile developers to skyrocket in recent years.</p>
                <p>Mobile app developers need to possess knowledge of objective C which is used traditionally to create iOS apps. Another commonly used programming language is Swift. For android devices, they must also have a working knowledge of Java.</p>
                <p><strong>Data Scientist</strong> &nbsp;</p>
                <p>Data science is one of the most trending fields in tech. </p>
                <p>Organizations collect huge volumes of consumer information and need data scientists to organize and analyze this data. The main responsibility of a data scientist is to look for patterns and find useful conclusions. These conclusions can
                    be used to make informed business decisions to improve products and gain an advantage over the competition. &nbsp;</p>
                <p>The two programming languages essential for data science are Python and R. The most in-demand skills include SQL, Spark, Cloud, Amazon Web Services, JavaTensorFlow, Hadoop, and SAS. </p>
                <p><strong>Game Developer</strong> &nbsp;</p>
                <p>This is a competitive field, but a dream career for those who enjoy gaming. Game developers use coding to transform ideas, drawings, and mechanics into engaging video games. It might already sound too good to be true, but you can top it
                    off with a comfortable salary too. &nbsp; </p>
                <p>Game developers need to know programming languages such as C, C++, Java, and C#. They’re also experts in frameworks like DirectX, OpenGL, Unity3D, and WebGL. </p>
                <p>For developing mobile games, knowledge of Swift is needed for iOS and Java for Android games. </p>
                <h3 id="typical-coding-career-path">Typical Coding Career Path </h3>
                <p>One of the best aspects of the coding field is the almost unlimited growth potential. Here are some of the most common steps in a coder’s career journey, from first job to leader.</p>
                <p><strong>Junior Developer</strong> </p>
                <p>The primary role of a junior developer is to build quality, bug-free software that meets client expectations. You’ll use your knowledge of programming languages, algorithms, and databases. </p>
                <p>As this is an entry-level position, you’ll spend a significant amount of time developing your coding skills. You may find coding certain applications a challenge, but this is your opportunity to learn the <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/blog/how-to-become-a-software-developer-2/">software development</a>                    lifecycle. </p>
                <p><strong>Senior Developer</strong> </p>
                <p>After gaining three to four years of experience, you’ll now be proficient in writing complex software applications. You’ll have also gained more in-depth knowledge of databases and algorithms. Now you’re fully aware of the complexity of
                    the entire software/application lifecycle. </p>
                <p><strong>Lead Architect </strong> </p>
                <p>A lead architect is responsible for designing the entire software system. You’ll oversee the day-to-day coding which is implemented by a team of junior developers. The technical skills gained with years of experience as a junior and senior
                    developer help you take on the lead architect role. </p>
                <p><strong>Mid-Level Manager</strong> </p>
                <p>The traditional way to move ahead in your career is to become a manager. Typical managerial roles include a product manager, developer manager, or a project manager. If you’re someone with strong leadership skills and can drive a team
                    forwards, then this is the job for you. </p>
                <p><strong>Senior Leader </strong> </p>
                <p>As you go further up the career ladder, your job will involve less coding. You’ll take on a role where you’ll be heading a team of mid-level managers. Your job is to motivate and inspire your team towards achieving company goals. </p>
                <h3 id="what-do-coders-do">What Do Coders Do? </h3>
